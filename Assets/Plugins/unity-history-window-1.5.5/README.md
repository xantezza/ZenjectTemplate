# Unity Selection History Window

This is a small plugin that keeps a history of the Unity's Editor object selection (it stores in the background) and displays it in a Window to easily access it. 

It is really useful when editing stuff and following a link to an object reference to see some details and then go back to previous selection.

# Features

* Stores history of selected objects (custom count).
* Selects objects from the history (with left click).
* Pings (focus) objects from the history (with right click or Ping button).
* Drag objects from history to other object fields to link them.
* Drag assets (folders, scripts, etc) from history to the project browser to move them.
